# Project-7
This program practices using structures, accepting an input file (mp7divers.txt) containing 
data that consists of multiple divers, each with a set of scores and the difficulty of their dive. Based 
on the dive difficulty and all of their scores, each diver's total score is calculated, and the program 
prints out the winner of the competition, along with their total score count to an output file (mp7output.txt).
